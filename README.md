- I am currently a Senior in high schoolüéì. I will be attending Iowa State university in the fall of 2025.
- I fell in love with programming in 8th-grade. When my Math teacher introduced our class to [code.org](https://studio.code.org/home).
  - I made this game called [Parasite](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/soUL_QYf-GB6COfxI166hbMCrXgdkpScTMsAQ8FbnRw) which I was very proud, still am to be honest, and spent a lot of time working on it. It is almost 1000 lines of code, and until my teacher moved, he would showcase my game to classes to show what they could acomplish.
- I love to hangout with friends and family, and my girlfriend of 2 years
- Things I enjoy doing include: board/card games, homeserver, lifting weights, running, video games, and more.
