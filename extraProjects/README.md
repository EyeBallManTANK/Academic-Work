These are some of my extra projects

####[Parasite](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/soUL_QYf-GB6COfxI166hbMCrXgdkpScTMsAQ8FbnRw):
  I originally Programmed this game on a website called [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home). I spent many many hours on this game and it was my first PROPER programing experience.
  This Game is nothing crazy and has its fair share of bugs but it is near and dear to my heart nonetheless.
